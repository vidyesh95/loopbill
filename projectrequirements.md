# Project Requirements: Pest Control Service Management System

## 1. Service Lifecycle and Redo Logic – Full Specification

### 1.1 System Roles & Access Levels
- **Admin**
    - Can create users: Salesperson, Agent, Customer
    - Access to system reports, including sales KPIs and agent performance
    - Can view historical and real-time data of all users
- **Salesperson**
    - Can create customer profiles
    - Can create and manage locations (Building, Wing, Flat No, etc.)
    - Assigns customers and locations to agents for service
    - Handles back-office operations including rescheduling if the customer is not present
- **Agent**
    - Can view only assigned tasks and locations
    - Marks services as completed post-visit

    - Receives emails for invoices and receipts

### 1.2 Package Structure Overview
- Each pest control package includes 3 scheduled services
- Validity:
    - **1st Service**: Must be completed in the same calendar month as purchase
    - **2nd & 3rd Services**: Scheduled between 90 and 120 days after the previous service
    - Contracts expire if more than 151 days pass without scheduling the next service

### 1.3 Service Interval Enforcement Rules
| Service Stage  | Time Window                | System Behavior                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1st Service    | Within purchase month      | Manual reminder by Salesperson         |
| 2nd Service    | 90–120 days from 1st       | Reminders on Day 90 and Day 120        |
| 3rd Service    | 90–120 days from 2nd       | Reminders on Day 90 and Day 120        |
| Grace Period   | After Day 151              | Final expiration notice; contract locked |

### 1.4 System Notifications and Dashboard Actions
- WhatsApp/SMS reminders sent on Day 90, Day 120, and Day 151 for pending services
- Admin dashboard shows customers at risk of expiry within 7, 15, and 30 days
- Salespersons can adjust scheduled dates only within the valid range (90–120 days)
- Agents can only see assigned work; they cannot close out-of-range services without override

### 1.5 Redo and Complaint Handling
- Complaints must be raised within the same calendar month of the original service
- Admin sees the complaint 2 days after it is raised
- Redo service can be scheduled only after 3 days of the complaint being attended
- Only one redo is allowed per service unless overridden by Admin
- Salespersons may view complaints, but only Admin can assign redoes

#### Redo Workflow
| Stage              | System Action                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Complaint Raised   | System logs date of complaint               |
| Admin Visibility   | Complaint shown to Admin after 2 days       |
| Redo Eligibility   | 3-day cooldown after complaint is attended  |
| Assignment         | Admin assigns redo to Agent                 |
| Redo Completion    | Agent completes and system logs redo        |

### 1.6 Missed Service or Customer Absence
- If a customer is not available, Agent informs the Salesperson
- Salesperson marks a job as "Reschedule Required" and contacts the customer
- Salesperson schedules a new date within customer availability
- System may restrict to a maximum of 2 rescheduling per service
- Repeated absences flag the contract for Admin review

### 1.7 Summary of Key Rules
